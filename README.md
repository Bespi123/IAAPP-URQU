This report is part of the project “Space Geodesy for monitoring of Volcanoes and Surrounding Hills of Arequipa to Determine Deformation and Risks” which is financed by the National University of San Agustin under contract IBA-0049-2016.

Historically, Arequipa, which is located within the "Ring of Fire", has special seismic-tectonic conditions and the presence of the Misti Volcano adds seismic-volcanological conditions. The objective of this project is to implement a monitoring network that allows analyzing deformations before, during and after seismic and volcanological events by applying spatial geodesy techniques, allowing possible risks to be alerted. Within the techniques used for spatial Geodesy, there are the GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System), SLR (Satellite Laser Ranging), VLBI (Very Long Baseline Interferometry) and DORIS (Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite) that allow measurements with centimeter or millimeter precision in both planimetry and altimetry. Regarding measurements on land, the EDM (Electronic Distance Meter) technique is available with a precision of 0.5–1.0 mm for distances between 1 to 12 km, which were used to calculate the deformation of the Long Valley Caldera east of Yosemite in 2005 in the United States.

In this report, the **GNSS** technique was used to monitor the Misti volcano during the years 2021 and 2022. These techniques are based on satellite constellations that use the triangulation algorithm to determine the position and speed of a certain point. Among the most famous constellations we have: **GPS**, **GLONASS**, **BEIDU**, **GALILEO**. Also, **GAMIT/GLOBK** is presented as a software developed by **MIT** that allows estimating the three-dimensional relative positions of ground **GNSS** stations, satellite orbits, atmospheric zenith delays and orientation parameters of the Earth. **GAMIT** is able to reduce the error of the measurements using various ionospheric, atmospheric, meteorological and oceanic correction models with which this software allows obtaining daily measurements (24 hour sessions) with millimeter errors (< 9mm). Currently **GAMIT** is widely used by international geodetic institutions such as the International GNSS Service ( **IGS** ) and the Geocentric Reference System for the Americas ( **SIRGAS** ) and peruvian national institutions such as the National Geographic Institute ( **IGN** ) and the Geological Mining and Metallurgical Institute ( **INGEMMET** ) for volcano monitoring.
