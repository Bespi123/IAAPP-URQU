This report is part of the project “Space Geodesy for monitoring of Volcanoes and Surrounding Hills of Arequipa to Determine Deformation and Risks” which is financed by the National University of San Agustin under contract IBA-0049-2016.
Historically, Arequipa, which is located within the "Ring of Fire", has special seismic-tectonic conditions and the presence of the Misti Volcano adds seismic-volcanological conditions. The objective of this project is to implement a monitoring network that allows analyzing deformations before, during and after seismic and volcanological events by applying spatial geodesy techniques, allowing possible risks to be alerted. Within the techniques used for spatial Geodesy, there are the GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System), SLR (Satellite Laser Ranging), VLBI (Very Long Baseline Interferometry) and DORIS (Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite) that allow measurements with centimeter or millimeter precision in both planimetry and altimetry. Regarding measurements on land, the EDM (Electronic Distance Meter) technique is available with a precision of 0.5–1.0 mm for distances between 1 to 12 km, which were used to calculate the deformation of the Long Valley Caldera east of Yosemite in 2005 in the United States.
